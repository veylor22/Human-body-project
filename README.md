# ðŸ§¬ Human Body Interactive Website

This is an educational and interactive website created as a college web development project. It visually presents different systems of the human body (such as nervous, digestive, and circulatory) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes pages like About Us, Contact, Testimonials, a Health Calculation Form, and resources. All files are organized into folders for clarity: `/systems`, `/aboutus`, `/contactus`, `/calculationform`, `/resources`, `/images`, and `/styles`. No frameworks or servers are required â€” just open `index.html` in your browser. The project was created by a student team as part of a Web Development course at Applied science universaty . Team members include Albara Shamma ,  Izzeldeen Shalash, Shahd Rabaa , ruba allozi. Future improvements may include animated visuals, multi-language support, quizzes , and full deployment using GitHub Pages. This project is intended for academic use only.
